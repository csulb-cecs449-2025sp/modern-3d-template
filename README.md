# modern-3d-template

A template project for running a modern OpenGL 3.3+ application. Tested on Windows with Visual Studio, 
but it should also work with CLion.

Mesh files go in the /models directory, which is copied to the application's output directory when the 
program is built. 

Shader source files go in /shaders_source, which is copied to a directory named **shaders** in the application's
output directory when the program is built.
